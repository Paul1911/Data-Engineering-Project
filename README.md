# Data Engineering Project 

This is the project for my master's data engineering course. The task is to develop a reliable, scalabe and maintainable batch-processing data system while ensuring data security, governance and protection. The project itself was not predetermined and had to be chosen by me. 

For my project, I chose a scheduled execution of a credit card fraud classifier training, orchestrated via airflow using PostgreSQL for permanent storage and Plotly Dash for data and model quality monitoring. The whole project is containerized using Docker. 

This project is currently in development and will soon be finished, so in a few days you will find more information and a process flow chart here. Stay tuned!
